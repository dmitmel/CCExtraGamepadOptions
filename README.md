### This mod adds the following features:
- You may now swap L and R

- You may now swap A and B
- You may now swap X and Y
- The official Nintendo Switch gamepad icon theme, as seen in the Switch port of the game, is now a selectable icon theme
  - The Plus and Minus buttons on the Default theme have been replaced with more readable buttons
  - There are two additional color schemes for the Switch icon theme - SFC and SNES
  - The SFC (Super Famicom) and SNES (Super Nintendo) color schemes were made especially for users of the [8BitDo SN30Pro/SF30Pro](https://i.imgur.com/Ld8Zrnk.jpg)
